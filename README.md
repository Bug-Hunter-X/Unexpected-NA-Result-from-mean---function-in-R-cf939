This repository demonstrates a common, yet easily overlooked, issue in R when calculating the mean of a vector containing missing values (`NA`). The `bug.R` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.R` provides a corrected version using `na.rm = TRUE` to remove missing values before calculation. This simple fix prevents unexpected `NA` outputs and ensures correct mean calculation.
